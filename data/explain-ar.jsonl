This phenomenon is caused by the adhesive forces between the liquid and the container which are greater than the cohesive forces inside the liquid itself. This property allows liquids to flow against gravity and is the reason kerosene oil is able to rise up in the wick of a lantern."}

This is different from the concept of transposition, where a piece of music is simply moved up or down in pitch to a different key, while maintaining the same sequence of intervals. Therefore, the term \"progressive tonality\" does not describe a change in key in the same way that \"transposed\" or \"transposition\" does."}

{"question": "where does hydrogen peroxide come from in the body", "answer": ["nearly all living cells"], "prediction": "the immune system", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer mentioned that hydrogen peroxide comes from the immune system, which is partially correct, as hydrogen peroxide is produced by certain immune cells as part of their defense mechanisms. However, it's not entirely accurate to say that hydrogen peroxide comes only from the immune system. It's actually produced in nearly all living cells as a byproduct of metabolic processes, particularly during the breakdown of lipids and the oxidation of various molecules. Therefore, while the candidate answer isn't entirely wrong, it is limited in scope, so I would rate it as \"perhaps\" acceptable."}

In the Book of Revelation, there are indeed seven specific churches that are explicitly named and addressed in separate letters: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. So if the candidate answer \"seven churches\" is interpreted as a shorthand or abbreviated way of referring to these specific seven churches, then it could be considered acceptable.\n\nHowever, without additional context or clarification, it is difficult to definitively determine whether the candidate answer \"seven churches\" is being used in this specific way. Therefore, while it is possible that the candidate answer could be acceptable, it is not unambiguously so, and further information or clarification may be needed to make a definitive determination."}

{"question": "for complaints of sudden chest pain patients should take a", "answer": ["Aspirin"], "prediction": "cardiac examination", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe candidate answer \"cardiac examination\" is not a medication or treatment that a patient can take for sudden chest pain. It is a medical procedure or series of tests that a healthcare professional would administer to help diagnose the cause of the chest pain. In contrast, aspirin is a medication that can be taken to help reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. It does this by preventing blood clots from forming or getting bigger, and it can be beneficial for some people experiencing chest pain. In general, if someone is experiencing sudden and severe chest pain, they should seek medical attention immediately."}

However, it is more common to say that the urinary bladder is located on the pelvic floor or in the pelvic cavity, as the known acceptable answers state. Therefore, while the candidate answer is not necessarily wrong, it may be less clear or precise than the commonly accepted answers."}

{"question": "name the cell which is attached to the lateral side of sieve tube", "answer": ["sieve tube elements"], "prediction": "albuminous cells", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAlbuminous cells, also known as companion cells, are found in the phloem tissue of plants, but they are not attached to the lateral side of sieve tubes. Instead, they are closely associated with sieve tubes and are connected to them via numerous plasmodesmata. These connections allow for the movement of nutrients between the two cell types. However, albuminous cells are not directly attached to the lateral side of sieve tubes.\n\nTherefore, the candidate answer of albuminous cells is not acceptable."}
{"question": "where was the flag placed on the moon", "answer": ["Hadley\u00e2\u20ac\u201cApennine", "Ocean of Storms", "Fra Mauro formation", "Descartes Highlands", "Sea of Tranquility", "Taurus\u00e2\u20ac\u201cLittrow"], "prediction": "horizontal bars", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.

Covington, Kentucky, is directly across the river from the lower part of Cincinnati, Ohio, and they are essentially connected as one large metropolitan area. Therefore, it is possible that parts of the movie \"Strangers: Prey at Night\" could have been filmed in the lower Cincinnati area, even though the main filming location was in Covington, Kentucky. However, without further information, it's not possible to say for certain whether the candidate answer is correct."}
{"question": "how did the dominican republic get its name", "answer": ["patron saint, Saint Dominic"], "prediction": "La Isla Espaola", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe name \"Dominican Republic\" comes from the patron saint of the country, Saint Dominic.

{"question": "when is the end of the football season", "answer": ["February 4, 2018"], "prediction": "December or early January", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer \"December or early January\" does not match the known acceptable answer of \"February 4, 2018\", which is a specific date. However, the candidate answer is somewhat acceptable because the football season (specifically the NFL) does indeed end in early January, when the playoffs take place. The Super Bowl, which is the championship game, is held in early February, which is why February 4, 2018 is a known acceptable answer.\n\nSo, while the candidate answer is not exactly the same as the known acceptable answer, it is still plausible and might be considered correct depending on the context of the question."}

They are one of the oldest and most successful teams in the National Hockey League (NHL).

However, if you are referring to the historical context of Lucius (who becomes Emperor Lucius Verus in real history), his father is Lucius Ceionius Commodus, who was adopted by the emperor Hadrian and changed his name to Aelius Caesar before becoming Lucius Verus' father.

Michael Rooker plays the character Yondu, who is a member of the Ravagers and has a blue skin tone, but he is not a Guardian and is not imprisoned in the same setting as Blast\u00e9rave.

This contribution was introduced in 1989 under the Hawke Labor government, and replaced the previous system where the government funded universities entirely.\n\nTherefore, the candidate answer is incorrect because university was not entirely free even before 1974."}
{"question": "panic at the disco song about a wedding", "answer": ["I Write Sins Not Tragedies"], "prediction": "Beautiful World", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe song \"Beautiful World\" by Panic! at the Disco is not about a wedding.

Nonetheless, Mark Selwyn Hadlow does play a significant dwarf character in The Hobbit series."}
{"question": "when do you declare honors in contract bridge", "answer": ["any time after the auction"], "prediction": "the first trick", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nIn the card game of contract bridge, honors refer to certain high-ranking cards in a suit: the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. Honors are often used in the context of bidding and scoring, but there is no specific time or occasion during the play of the cards when honors are \"declared.\" Players may announce that they have honors in a suit while bidding, but this is not required and serves only to convey information to their partner. Once the auction is over and play begins, there is no further opportunity to declare honors.\n\nTherefore, the candidate answer is not acceptable because it suggests that honors can be declared during the play of the cards, which is not the case."}

When the Mormons were expelled from the county in 1833, some non-Mormons who remained behind and did not actively oppose the Mormons came to be known as \"Jack Mormons.\" The term has since been used more broadly to refer to Mormons who are not active in the church or who do not strictly follow its teachings, but its origins are specifically linked to Jackson County, Missouri."}

{"question": "who has won the most united states championships", "answer": ["Ric Flair", "Lex Luger"], "prediction": "Green Bay Packers", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team, and they have won multiple championships in their league. However, these championships are not related to the United States championships mentioned in the question, which appear to be related to professional wrestling. Ric Flair and Lex Luger are both professional wrestlers who have won multiple United States championships."}

The first issue of \"Wonder Woman\" was technically released in December 1941, although the cover is dated January 1942."}
{"question": "what are the four requirements to establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter", "answer": ["the defendant breached this duty"], "prediction": "a duty of care", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer \"a duty of care\" is an important element in establishing criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter, but it is not one of the four requirements on its own. The four requirements to establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter are:\n\n1. The defendant owed a duty of care to the victim.\n2. The defendant breached this duty.\n3. The breach caused the victim's death.\n4. The breach amounted to gross negligence.\n\nSo while the candidate answer is an important component of the first requirement, it does not fully capture the complexity of the four requirements as a whole. However, given that the candidate answer is phrased as \"a duty of care\" rather than \"one requirement is a duty of care,\" it can still be considered as an acceptable albeit incomplete answer."}
{"question": "who does the voice of alistair in dragon age", "answer": ["Steve Valentine"], "prediction": "Steve Valentine", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nSteve Valentine is the voice actor for the character Alistair in the Dragon Age series.

{"question": "who is in charge of new issues not mentioned in the constitution", "answer": ["Congress"], "prediction": "the states or the people", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe candidate answer suggests that either the states or the people would be in charge of new issues not mentioned in the Constitution. However, the Constitution does not delegate such authority to the states or the people. Instead, it grants Congress the authority to make laws necessary and proper for carrying out the Constitution's provisions. This authority, known as the Necessary and Proper Clause, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the power to address new issues not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, Congress is in charge of new issues not mentioned in the Constitution."}
{"question": "where does trick or treat for unicef money go", "answer": ["UNICEF's global programing"], "prediction": "The U.S. Fund", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe U.S. Fund for UNICEF is one of the many national committees that support UNICEF's global programming. Therefore, while \"The U.S. Fund\" is not an exact match for the known acceptable answer, it is a related organization that also supports UNICEF's mission. Nonetheless, it is important to clarify that Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF collections typically support UNICEF's global programing rather than The U.S. Fund specifically."}

{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "answer": ["1934", "October 1976", "August 15, 1971"], "prediction": "1971", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nThe U.S. dollar officially left the gold standard in 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, thus effectively ending the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Therefore, the candidate answer of 1971 is acceptable."}

Google Glass uses a type of display called a head-up display or optical head-mounted display, which is a transparent display that is mounted in front of the user's eye and presents information in the user's field of view. Holographic screens, on the other hand, are displays that use laser beams to create 3D images in mid-air. They are not used in Google Glass."}

{"question": "which term describes the replacement of damaged cells to mend a tissue", "answer": ["Stromal cells"], "prediction": "Regenerative medicine", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nRegenerative medicine is a branch of medicine that focuses on the replacement, engineering, or regeneration of human cells, tissues, or organs to restore or establish normal function. This process often involves the use of stem cells or progenitor cells, which can differentiate into various cell types to replace the damaged or lost cells in a tissue.\n\nWhile regenerative medicine is related to the replacement of damaged cells in tissue repair, it is not an exact synonym for the term. Therefore, the candidate answer can be considered somewhat close but not identical to the known acceptable answer."}
{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "answer": ["Continental drift"], "prediction": "ridge-push", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe candidate answer, \"ridge-push,\" refers to a process that is part of plate tectonics and contributes to the movement of lithospheric plates. However, it is not the main process responsible for continental drift. Continental drift is driven primarily by convection currents in the underlying semi-fluid asthenosphere, which generate forces that cause the continents to move apart or collide. Ridge-push refers to the secondary force that occurs when the dense, cooled oceanic lithosphere at a mid-ocean ridge is pushed down and away from the ridge, causing the adjoining plates to move apart. Therefore, it is not an equivalent or alternative answer to continental drift."}

However, it is not an exact match for the provided acceptable answer, so a more appropriate response might be \"(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\""}

{"question": "when was zero first used in mathematical operations", "answer": ["7th\u00a0century", "By 1770\u00c2\u00a0BC"], "prediction": "AD 628", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer, AD 628, refers to the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta's work (Brahmasphutasiddhanta) where he described rules for using zero in mathematical operations, including the concept of zero as a number. However, it is important to note that the usage of zero in mathematical operations can be traced back to Babylonian and Mayan civilizations by 1770 BC, although it was not explicitly used as a number like in Brahmagupta's work.\n\nIn summary, the candidate answer isn't exactly the same as the established answers, but it still holds relevance in the history of mathematics and the development of mathematical operations involving zero."}
{"question": "the lowest temperature at which a lubricant will flow is called the", "answer": ["pour point"], "prediction": "freezing point", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe freezing point is the temperature at which a substance transitions from a liquid to a solid, while the pour point is the lowest temperature at which a lubricant will flow. These two concepts are not identical, as the pour point is typically lower than the freezing point due to the increased viscosity of lubricants as they approach their freezing points."}

However, it is possible that the melody of the song was composed by a young man named John Roulstone. Nevertheless, Sarah Josepha Hale is widely recognized as the author of the lyrics of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\""}

He indeed used inductive reasoning, but not as an early advocate for using scientific methods based on inductive reasoning. Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Aristotle are more fitting choices, given their substantial contributions to laying the foundations for scientific inquiry based on inductive reasoning."}

However, it is important to note that there may have been earthquakes in Iran during other dates of 2017. Therefore, while \"2017\" is not incorrect, it may not provide enough information to accurately answer the question."}
{"question": "where is the deepest lake in the us located", "answer": ["Oregon"], "prediction": "Oregon", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nThe deepest lake in the US is Crater Lake, which is located in Oregon. So, the candidate answer \"Oregon\" is acceptable since it correctly implies the location of the deepest lake in the US."}
{"question": "who is the largest supermarket chain in the uk", "answer": ["Tesco", "Aldi"], "prediction": "Tesco", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTesco is one of the known acceptable answers, so the candidate answer Tesco is acceptable.

In some cases, it might be acceptable to consider \"1940\" as a shorthand or simplified version of the more specific date. However, in other cases, it might be important to provide the exact date, so \"1940\" would not be acceptable."}

{"question": "where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery", "answer": ["lungs", "The pulmonary vein"], "prediction": "lungs", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate answer is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nThe pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs. After passing through the lungs, this blood, now oxygen-rich, is returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. Therefore, the answer \"lungs\" is essentially the same as \"pulmonary vein\" because it denotes the destination of the blood after leaving the pulmonary artery."}

Therefore, while \"breech\" is not strictly the same as \"footling breech,\" it might still be considered acceptable in some contexts. However, it is always best to use the more precise term \"footling breech\" when describing a baby that comes out feet-first."}
{"question": "when did they start vaccinating for whooping cough", "answer": ["the 1920s", "the 1940s"], "prediction": "1925", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe candidate answer, 1925, is acceptable because it falls within the range of the known acceptable answers, the 1920s.

This vaccine was initially used as a standalone vaccine but was later combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, leading to the development of the DTP vaccine, which was introduced in the 1940s.

{"question": "what is the source of information for account receivables", "answer": ["invoices"], "prediction": "sales ledger", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer, \"sales ledger,\" is not exactly the same as the known acceptable answer, \"invoices,\" but it is related. A sales ledger is a record of a company's sales, and it typically includes information about each transaction, such as the date, the customer, and the amount. Invoices are typically used to bill customers for the goods or services they have received, and they are an important source of information for account receivables. So, while the sales ledger is not the primary source of information for account receivables, it may contain the same information that is found on invoices and can therefore be used as a source of information for account receivables."}

However, in the context of crosswords, \"span\" is the more commonly used term to describe the distance across a bridge. So while \"distance\" isn't necessarily incorrect, \"span\" would be a more accepted answer in a crossword puzzle."}

However, it is not necessarily incorrect, either, since it is one of the types of precipitation that was mentioned."}

The reason for his return was not specifically due to a \"no-compete\" clause, but rather because of a financial dispute with WCW and a desire to take a break from wrestling. Flair had left WCW in July 1991 to join the WWF, but his contract with WCW contained a clause that allowed him to return to the company after a year had passed.

The name Hansen is derived from the given name Hans, which is a short form of Johannes (John). The surname Hansen indicates that the person is a son of a man named Hans.\n\nHowever, the candidate answer does not specify which specific countries the surname Hansen is commonly found in, so it is less specific than the known acceptable answers. Nonetheless, the candidate answer is not necessarily incorrect, as the surname Hansen is indeed of Scandinavian origin and is common in Norway, Denmark, and other Scandinavian countries."}
{"question": "who said life is like a bowl of cherries", "answer": ["Lew Brown"], "prediction": "Willie Howard", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer, Willie Howard, is not exactly the same as the known acceptable answer, Lew Brown. However, it is possible that this candidate answer is also correct because Willie Howard sometimes performed and wrote songs with Lew Brown, and they co-wrote a song called \"Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries\" in the 1930s. So, while it is not a perfect match, it is plausible that Willie Howard could be considered acceptable in this context."}

{"question": "what is the highest base on the ph scale", "answer": ["greater than 14"], "prediction": "Sodium hydroxide", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of a solution, with values ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, values below 7 indicate acidity, and values above 7 indicate basicity. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base, but it doesn't directly answer the question about the highest base on the pH scale. The pH of a sodium hydroxide solution would be greater than 14 due to its high basicity, but the statement \"Sodium hydroxide\" is not an appropriate response to the question."}
{"question": "where is the love meaning of the song", "answer": ["lament on various worldwide problems"], "prediction": "romantic love", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe song \"Where Is the Love\" by The Black Eyed Peas is not about romantic love.

{"question": "when is the strictly come dancing results show recorded", "answer": ["Sunday night", "Saturday"], "prediction": "on Saturday", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nWhile the Strictly Come Dancing results show is typically recorded on Sunday night, there have been instances where it was recorded on Saturday due to scheduling conflicts or special events.

Therefore, the candidate answer of \"a spherical tooth\" is not accurate and not acceptable."}

The candidate answer, while it describes a part of the fruit, does not explain the origin of the sweetness itself."}
{"question": "who plays drew's boyfriend on the night shift", "answer": ["Rick"], "prediction": "Brendan Jacob Joel Fehr", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nWhile \"Brendan Jacob Joel Fehr\" is the real-life actor who plays Drew's boyfriend on The Night Shift, it seems you didn't provide an actual character name. \"Rick\" is the character's name, not the actor's name. So, based on the provided information, it is unclear whether the candidate answer is a name of a character or the actor. However, the actor's name is Brendan Jacob Joel Fehr, and he plays the character named \"Rick\" on The Night Shift, which matches the known acceptable answer."}

Both are equivalent in terms of pay and responsibilities within the military hierarchy. However, they have different roles and duties. A Master Sergeant typically serves as a specialty leader or operations chief in a unit, while a First Sergeant is the senior enlisted advisor to the commanding officer and is in charge of the unit's morale, welfare, and discipline.\n\nTherefore, the candidate answer \"Master Sergeant\" is acceptable as it is one of the two E-8 ranks in the Marine Corps."}

However, it is not uncommon for people to refer to the host country instead of the specific region/city/county, so in this context, the candidate answer can be considered acceptable."}
{"question": "which came first the walking dead comic or show", "answer": ["comic", "comic book"], "prediction": "comic book series", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer \"comic book series\" is slightly different from the known acceptable answer \"comic,\" but it can still be considered acceptable since \"comic book series\" implies a comic format."}

However, it is possible that the question might have been misremembered or misheard, and Lisa Nicole Carson was the person the questioner was thinking of. Therefore, while the candidate answer is not technically correct, it might still be acceptable in some contexts."}
{"question": "where is the protien made in the cell", "answer": ["in the cell nucleus", "cell nucleus"], "prediction": "ribosome exit channel", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe candidate answer \"ribosome exit channel\" is not the correct location for protein synthesis. While it's true that proteins are synthesized on ribosomes, the exit channel is not where the protein is made. It is simply the passage through which the newly synthesized protein exits the ribosome. The actual formation of the protein polypeptide chain occurs within the ribosome, which can be found in various locations within the cell, not just the nucleus."}
{"question": "who is given credit for inventing the aqua lung", "answer": ["engineer \u00c9mile Gagnan", "\u00c3\u2030mile Gagnan", "Jacques Cousteau"], "prediction": "Jacques Cousteau", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nJacques Cousteau is indeed credited with inventing the aqua-lung, but it's important to note that he developed it in collaboration with engineer \u00c9mile Gagnan.

{"question": "who is the valley of the dolls based on", "answer": ["Carole Landis", "Ethel Merman", "Dean Martin", "Judy Garland"], "prediction": "Carole Landis", "ynu": "B", "long_answer": "(B) Yes - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but I am confident it is also correct.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe novel \"Valley of the Dolls\" by Jacqueline Susann was not based on any one individual, but was rather an amalgamation of various people and experiences in Susann's own life. However, some characters in the novel were inspired by real-life individuals, including the character of Neely O'Hara, who was loosely based on Judy Garland, Ethel Merman, and Carole Landis, as well as aspects of other celebrities of the time. Therefore, while Carole Landis is one of the inspirations for the character of Neely O'Hara, she is not the sole basis for the novel \"Valley of the Dolls.\""}

However, it is possible that the candidate answer is acceptable, as there are many island countries around the world, such as Jamaica, Madagascar, and New Zealand. However, more information would be needed to determine if the candidate answer is being used in the same context as the original question."}

However, Ella Mitchell did play Big Momma in the TV series \"Gimme a Break!\" in the 1980s. She is not related to the \"Big Momma's House\" movie franchise, where Martin Lawrence plays the character Big Momma.\n\nTherefore, while Ella Mitchell is not one of the known acceptable answers for the question \"who plays Big Momma in Big Momma's House,\" she did play a similar character named Big Momma, and her name is sometimes mistakenly associated with the movie franchise.\n\nTherefore, while the candidate answer is not strictly correct, it might still be acceptable in some contexts."}

The canonicity of certain books was a matter of debate among early Christians, but there was no official removal of any books from the Bible during that time. Instead, the current 27-book New Testament canon was mostly established by the 4th century. The Old Testament canon, however, was not officially established until the Council of Rome in 1546, when seven deuterocanonical books were officially declared as apocryphal by the Catholic Church, hence the known acceptable answer being 1546."}

He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, and his rookie season was in 2000. Therefore, Tom Brady's professional football career has lasted 21 seasons (2000-2021), not 18."}

However, Jekyll or Hyde, portrayed by Hank Harris and Sam Witwer respectively, are also characters that die in the same season. Therefore, while Robin Hood's death is a significant plot point, it is not one of the known acceptable answers for this specific question."}

Scott de Martinville invented the phonautograph, a device that could record sound waves as visual tracings on paper. However, the phonautograph was not capable of playing back recorded sounds. Therefore, while the candidate answer is related to the development of sound recording, it is not exactly the same as the known acceptable answer."}

However, Mike Czerwien, who played for North Dakota State from 1981 to 1984, is credited with the most sacks in a single season with 28 sacks in 1984.

{"question": "when did the democratic party change its name", "answer": ["the 1830s"], "prediction": "1844", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe Democratic Party did not officially change its name, but it did go through a significant transformation in the 1830s and early 1840s. The party, which had its roots in the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party, underwent a shift in the 1830s as it moved away from the more conservative wing of the party, which became the Whig Party. The Democratic Party, under the leadership of Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, adopted a more populist and states' rights platform.\n\nIn 1844, the Democratic Party held its national convention and officially nominated James K. Polk for president. Polk's campaign focused on the annexation of Texas, which had been an independent republic since 1836, and the expansion of U.S. territory. Polk's victory in the 1844 presidential election is sometimes seen as a turning point for the Democratic Party, as it cemented the party's commitment to expansionism and states' rights.\n\nSo while the Democratic Party did not officially change its name in 1844, the election of James K. Polk and the party's focus on expansionism and states' rights that year could be seen as a significant moment in the party's history."}

The three-point line was added to the NBA before the 1979-80 season, so it is possible that the candidate answer refers to the time period during which the rule change was made. However, it is more common to refer to a season by the year in which it starts, rather than the month, so the candidate answer may be less clear to some people. Therefore, while the candidate answer is not necessarily incorrect, it is also not the most commonly used or clear way of expressing the time period in question."}
{"question": "when was the last time someone won the super bowl back to back", "answer": ["2004"], "prediction": "2015", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe candidate answer of 2015 is not acceptable because it is not the most recent time a team won the Super Bowl back to back.

Misbah-ul-haq of Pakistan was facing Joginder Sharma, who was bowling the final over for India. So, the candidate answer is incorrect."}
{"question": "who was the youngest president to be elected", "answer": ["John F. Kennedy", "Theodore Roosevelt"], "prediction": "Theodore Roosevelt", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers.\n\nThe candidate answer, Theodore Roosevelt, is indeed correct. He was the youngest person to become President of the United States, although he did not win a presidential election at that young age. Rather, he assumed the presidency at the age of 42 after President McKinley was assassinated. This occurred in September 1901, near the end of McKinley's second term, so Roosevelt served the remaining few months of that term and then was elected to two full terms of his own.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, the other name suggested as a possible answer to this question, was also young when he was elected president, but he was not as young as Roosevelt. Kennedy was 43 when he assumed the presidency in 1961."}

The correct answer is (C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable because it is related to the concept. The actual chemical change that proinsulin undergoes to become mature insulin is post-translational modification, which includes cleavage of the C-peptide and connection of the A and B chains of the proinsulin molecule."}

So while 1995 is the more accurate answer, 1996 might also be acceptable as the name change was a process rather than a single event."}
{"question": "when does season 7 game of thrones dvd release", "answer": ["December 12, 2017"], "prediction": "December 12, 2017", "ynu": "A", "long_answer": "(A) Yes - the candidate is essentially the same as one of the known acceptable answers."}
{"question": "when did the twenty one pilots hiatus start", "answer": ["November 2016", "July 2017"], "prediction": "July 2017", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nWhile the most often cited start of the hiatus is November 2016, there are sources that suggest July 2017 as the starting point. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that the band members themselves never explicitly defined the timeline of their break. Some media outlets might use July 2017 as the start of the hiatus because it was when the band went on an extended social media blackout. Nonetheless, both November 2016 and July 2017 can be considered valid starting points of twenty one pilots' hiatus, depending on the interpretation of their public activities during that period."}
{"question": "who becomes chief resident on grey's anatomy season 7", "answer": ["April Kepner M.D.", "Kepner"], "prediction": "April", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer \"April\" is missing the last name \"Kepner\" and the title \"M.D.\", which are both included in the known acceptable answers. However, it is possible that \"April\" is being used as a short form for \"April Kepner\" in this context, especially if it is in a setting where her full name and title have already been established. Nonetheless, it would be preferable to use the full name \"April Kepner\" or the short form \"Kepner\" to avoid any ambiguity."}
{"question": "when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood", "answer": ["week 4 of development", "by week 4 of development"], "prediction": "three weeks into embryogenesis", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe candidate answer states that the heart begins to pump blood \"three weeks into embryogenesis.\" While this is roughly equivalent to the more commonly stated \"week 4 of development,\" it is phrased differently and uses different terminology, which could potentially cause confusion. Therefore, I would rate the candidate answer as \"perhaps\" acceptable, and recommend that it be clarified or rephrased to match the more widely accepted version."}

{"question": "when was the drinking age set to 21", "answer": ["By mid-1988"], "prediction": "1984", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe National Minimum Drinking Age Act was passed in 1984, which required all states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21 by 1988. So, while 1984 is the year the law was passed, it wasn't until 1988 that the drinking age was set to 21 nationwide. Therefore, the candidate answer is close but should be 1988 for the drinking age to be set to 21 everywhere in the U.S."}
{"question": "who produced the movie i can only imagine", "answer": ["Cindy Bond", "Raymond Harris", "Joe Knopp", "Mickey Liddell", "Daryl Lefever", "Kevin Downes", "Pete Shilaimon"], "prediction": "the Erwin Brothers", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe Erwin Brothers, Jonathan and Andrew Erwin, are indeed the directors of the movie \"I Can Only Imagine,\" but they are not listed in the options as producers.

However, the internet infrastructure and services such as email, file transfer, and newsgroups were already in use by the public, researchers, and organizations in the late 1980s.

{"question": "who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it", "answer": ["George Ransom Twiss", "Charles Riborg Mann", "Philosopher George Berkeley"], "prediction": "George Berkeley", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe quote \"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" is often attributed to George Berkeley, a philosopher. However, there's no record of Berkeley actually posing this question in his writings. Instead, this question is a summary of some of Berkeley's ideas about perception and reality. The question itself was likely first posed in this form in the 20th century, and it is unclear who first asked it. George Ransom Twiss, Charles Riborg Mann, and George Berkeley are all potential candidates, but there is no definitive answer.

However, it is not as specific or accurate as the known acceptable answer."}

Dylan's father in Bates Motel is actually Norma's husband, Sam Loomis, played by Joe Mantello in the TV series.

{"question": "who is the speaker in shooting an elephant", "answer": ["Orwell"], "prediction": "English narrator", "ynu": "C", "long_answer": "(C) Perhaps - the candidate is different from each of the known acceptable answers, but it might be acceptable.\n\nThe speaker in George Orwell's essay \"Shooting an Elephant\" is an unnamed English narrator who is a policeman in British-occupied Burma.

{"question": "why was the plague that struck athens so devastating", "answer": ["close quarters and poor hygiene"], "prediction": "typhus", "ynu": "D", "long_answer": "(D) No - the candidate is different from the known acceptable answers, and is incorrect.\n\nThe plague that struck Athens in 430 BC, commonly referred to as the Plague of Athens, was a devastating epidemic that had a significant impact on the city-state during the Peloponnesian War. Although the exact cause of the plague remains uncertain, it is widely believed to have been an outbreak of typhus or a similar infectious disease.\n\nHowever, the candidate answer \"typhus\" is not entirely accurate, as it oversimplifies the situation and leaves out other critical factors that contributed to the plague's devastating impact on Athens.\n\nThe Plague of Athens was particularly devastating due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Close Quarters: Athens was a densely populated city-state, with many people living in cramped and unsanitary conditions. This made it easy for the disease to spread rapidly among the population.\n2. Poor Hygiene: The lack of proper sanitation and hygiene practices, such as regular waste disposal and handwashing, contributed to the spread of the disease.\n3. Overcrowding: The city's overcrowded population made it difficult to isolate those infected with the disease, allowing it to spread quickly and easily.\n4. Weakened Immune Systems: The ongoing Peloponnesian War had weakened the immune systems of many Athenians, making them more susceptible to the disease.\n\nTherefore, while typhus may have been the primary cause of the Plague of Athens, the disease's devastating impact on the city-state was due to a combination of factors, including close quarters, poor hygiene, overcrowding, and weakened immune systems."}

Therefore, while 1936 was a particularly bad year for the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma, it did not mark the end of the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma. However, it's possible that the candidate answer is referring to a specific event or turning point in 1936 that marked the beginning of the end of the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma. Without further context or information, it's difficult to say for certain whether the candidate answer is acceptable or not."}

While it is similar to a \"callable bond,\" there is a slight difference. A callable bond specifically allows the issuer to redeem the bond prior to maturity, at specific call dates and prices.
